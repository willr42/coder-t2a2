Webserver Flask API project for CoderAcademy course.

# R1 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.

Amateur horticulturalists are faced with a huge knowledge area they need to track - all the varieties of plants they can keep. How much water they need, how often, what sort of soil they need, their climate conditions, and so on. And tracking the plants you actually own can be just as complicated.

# R2 	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

My API will allow a user to create their own virtual Garden. They can register an account using their email. They can then create a new Garden, and begin adding plants to it. This Garden will track the plants inside it, and track what plants have been watered recently, what have yet to be watered, and if any are overdue for their next watering. Creating this virtual representation of a garden means users can be in more control of their hobby than ever.

While I'm a team of one, I'm running this project in an Agile way. I've developed a backlog of features that I need in my app. There are some dependencies, which means being aware of assigning myself tasks before I'm able to actually complete them, so I'm using a Trello board where the hierarchy in the list represents their ability to be completed. When generating the backlog, I left notes for myself in terms of potential pitfalls or things to watch out for. 

The process involves moving each card into In Dev, where I work on the particular feature. Once complete, I move it to Dev Done. Tasks in Dev Done are considered provisionally complete. In a regular rhythm, I revisit the tasks in Dev Done and consider their future. Either they have generated further tasks I couldn't foresee, which go into the backlog. Or they require further development that I couldn't foresee, so they stay in this column. Or they are fully completed, in which case they enter Done.

This Kanban style of working is very visual and tactile, and I found it worked well on the previous assignment.
